### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

There was no major breackthrough during the creation of this little component. But it was the first ever thing I ever did without the use of a tutorial and using only a "prompt".

With that said, I'm looking forward to create new thing and have them all showcased here in GitHub
